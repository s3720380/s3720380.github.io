								<h2>My Favourite Hobby</h2>
								<p>I am particularly fond of watching film and television, with an interest in the works of
									Snyder, Sandler and Jon Favreau. If you were to ask me to mark down my top 5 favourite films
									i'd say you'd have to be more specific, what genre, which decade did it come out? who stars in it.
									These are all important questions to consider, however I have from time to time pondered my
									honest top 5 films and the following list is in no specific order.
								<h2>1. Shrek/Shrek 2</h2>
								<p> It is my honest belief that both Shrek 1 and 2 are timeless classics
									in the long list of movies for children. However the thing that sticks out to me
									is how anti-disney Shrek 1 is, with many jokes alluding to classic disney characters
									as well as behaviour entirely un-disney like. For example when Shrek blatantly
									insults and screams at all the people occupying his home, a moment where in a
									Disney movie a musical number would probably occur. Overall I would say these are
									two very strong movies suitable for an audience of any age. </p>
								<h2>2. The Dark Knight</h2>
								<p>This film really speaks to me, we truly live in a society. <p>
								<h2>3. Batman Vs Superman Dawn of Justice</h2>
								<p>This is a movie that is strongly reminiscent of "Excalibur",
									in fact during the opening sequence you can see that the theatre in which Bruce
									and his parents have just exitted is screening Excalibur 1981. When Batman is
									fighting Superman later in the film it is quite similar to when Arthur is fighting
									Lancelot, both good men who are fighting due to their idealogical differences,
									both also eventually reconciling to fight a greater evil. In "Excalibur 1981", Mordred
									is the son of Arthur and Morgana Le Fay, an unnatural union caused by Morgana's
									trickery. Similarly in "BvS" Doomsday is caused by the unnatural union of a
									Kryptonian and a Human, resulting in a monstrous creature hellbent on wreaking
									chaos and destruction. In "Excalibur 1981" Mordred is ultimately defeated when he
									is impaled by his father who is also mortally wounded, in "BvS" Doomsday is
									defeated when he is impaled by Superman who too is mortally wounded. However this
									is not the only subtext contained within the film. There are various scenes presented
									which are lifted off of famous artworks for example, after the final conflict when
									Superman and Wonderwoman are handling Superman's deceased form, the scene is shot
									in the exact same way as the famous "La descente de croix" a painting from the 16th
									century. In fact the sequences following this are further allusions to famous
									classical artists, Cristo Morto & Michelangelo's Pieta. Overall this is a fantastic
									film with a surprising amount of depth for a modern day superhero movie. <p>
								<h2>4. American Psycho</h2>
								<p>This movie introduced me to Huey Lewis and the News who I think
									really came out into their own with their breakout hit "It's hip to be square" a
									song I think that any audience can appreciate. In fact the whole album just has a
									real clear crisp sound, perhaps a result of a budget increase in their recording studio.
									In any case American Psycho is a fantastic film, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys
									music. <p>
								<h2>5. Man of Steel</h2>
								<p>This is a movie that makes me think back to the works of Plato,
									specifically "The Republic". The Ideal City is not just a place, but a metaphor
									for the human soul. In Man of Steel Jor-El imprints the codex within his son.
									The Codex is Krypton, and Krypton is the Ideal City. Superman has the Ideal City
									within himself, and he is a perfectly just being. In "The Republic" Plato states
									that the City is a "city of the mind", an ideal which one can strive towards.
									Superman is described in this way, as an ideal for humanity to strive towards.
									The real drama that "Man of Steel" revolves around is Superman having to choose
									between Krypton (The Ideal City) and Earth (The Imperfect City), and although
									every cell in Superman's being is Kryptonian, he instead decides to choose the
									imperfect Earth, hoping for humanity to change for the better. Because in reality
									Krypton is an artificial utopia, and through greed and corruption the planet is
									slowly consumed by the sins of its leaders. Overall this was a surprising entry
									into the superhero genre, with a fantastic soundtrack developed by Hans Zimmer. <p>
								<h2>Other Hobbies</h2>
								<p>Aside from film and television I have an interest in online gaming, as well as tabletop rpgs.
									Primarily the ones produced by WhiteWolf or Wizards of the Coast. I also have a pet sphinx called
									Maya that I look after although she does little more than sleep all day. <p>
