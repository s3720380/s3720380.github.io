										<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Since I was a kid I had always been around technology, I got an xbox when I was 4 and a computer when I was 6. When I got my computer,
										I spent a lot of time playing games on Cartoon Network's old website; And then when I was 8 I got a copy of Warcraft 3, after which I
										spent many hours developing custom maps and downloading resources off of mod distribution sites. When DoTA came out for Warcraft 3 I
										used to travel to my local library to participate in local tournaments though I never really went any far with it. I remember that
										being a big drive in my interest towards IT specifically in making games. <p>
									<p>Later in my life when I was 16 I signed up for a VET course
										in IT with a focus on game construction and Java. However it is through this course that I realised Game Design was more of a hobby
										than anything else for me and thus my interest shifted more towards Software Development in general compared to specifically Game Design.
										I chose to study at RMIT because it has a reputation for maintaining quality IT courses and it is convenient for me to travel to, I
										expect to learn a lot about different coding languages as well as the mechanical aspect of computers during my time at RMIT. That I can
										hopefully translate to a fruitful IT career. </p>

										<h2>My Ideal Job ~ <a href = "https://tinyurl.com/y63am76r"> Software Engineer, Agile Digital <a/> </h2>
									</header>
									<p>This position entails full time work at a Software Development house, where
										through a combination of experience with cloud platforms, knowledge of industrial
										languages such as Java, Python C# and knowledge of functional languages like
										Scala or Haskell I will work towards problem solving with a team. I find this
										job appealing as it requires the skills I intend to learn and allows for
										creativity and ingenuity when it comes to approaching work projects. <p>

									<p>In order to be considered for this position I will require
										-Technical Experience with an Industrial Language
										-Technical Experience with a Functional Language
										-The Ability to approach problems with common sense and creativity
										-The willingness to adapt to the changing market
										-An aptitude for working through Software Stacks <p>

									<p>Currently I only have limited technical experience with an Industrial language so
										it is something I will have to work on throughout my time at RMIT. I order to
										obtain the knowledge I do not currently possess I will work hard during my time at
										RMIT and take appropriate subjects in order to fill in the gaps in my knowledge
										and refine my abilities when it comes to Industrial Languages such as Java, C# ect. <p>

									<h2>Personality & Creativity Tests</h2>
									<p>These tests conclude for me at least that I learn optimally through visual methods, and work most
										effectively in short energised bursts, where my creativity has peaked. These results suggest that
										I will be a beneficial team mate when my intuition, and rational mind set can be utilised. When
										forming a team I will take this into account by finding like-minded individuals who utilise similar
										methods to approach finding solutions to problems. <p>

												<h2>My Dream Project</h2>
											</header>
											<p>In 2013, Open-World Survival Games flourished within the market, this success continued all
												the way to 2018, where the genre began to slowly die down in speed. However it is not due
												to people growing bored of the genre, it is due to the games of this genre being of a below
												average grade. I have always thought people would be fascinated with an Open-World Survival
												Game in which the player is thrusted into the Carribean, where they play from the perspective
												of a hopeful pirate. My thought is further educated by the fact that pirate Open-World games
												tend to far outsell their competitors; for example, Sea of Thieves surpassed a 5 million
												concurrent user account just a couple of months after it's release, whilst Conan Exiles another
												game of the genre has only ever peaked at 53000 concurrent users. <p>

										  <p>The gameplay would entail the user first constructing a basic raft, one that can simply sail out
												to nearby ships and then eventually acquiring enough parts and money to construct a more advanced
												ship capable of attacking larger vessels. The game would allow for users to cooperate through
												integrated voice chat, text chat and a sophisticated pinging system allowing for precise communication.
												Being an open world game it only makes sense to allow for users to determine whether they want to
												be playing against other players or purely against the ai, by allowing for multiple servers users can
												engage in both PVP and PVE, dependent on what server they're logged onto. By setting it up this
												way it allows for users to have choice when it comes down to how they want to play the game.
												Other potential features that could be implemented are, VR integration with the market
												constantly growing in size and with more and more consumers purchasing VR kits it only makes sense
												to offer options that allow for the VR gamer to play alongside regular users. If the game ends
												up being released on Steam or a similar platform that allows for user uploaded content it could
												be possible to integrate a modding workshop where users can create new content to play with on
												modded servers. Face-Scanning for more personal character customisation, and a built-in skin
												editor for weapons and vehicles. <p>

											<p>Constructing an Open-World game will not be easy however. Because games of this genre are heavily
												dependent on having a successful gameplay loop it is integral that this game's loop is unique as opposed
												to other similar titles and fun for the user to experience. In order to ensure the maximum possible user enjoyment
												and retention. This could be achieved through making the gameplay mechanics engaging enough to allow for both casual
												and more dedicated players to keep wanting to log on to play more. These mechanics can come in the form of a rewarding
												looting system as well as an intuitive hunger system that makes eating and drinking less tedious compared to other
												titles such as ARK, Minecraft ectAfter release it is important that the game recieves continued update and support
												to ensure it's userbase can continue growing even as other titles are launched in the genre. another important factor
												is ensuring that the game is large enough that the players are satisfied with the world they're exploring and
												contempt with its size. Finally, allowing for customisability lets users personalise their player character and
												raft enabling them to maintain a distinct identity and allowing for veteran players to flex their in-game wealth
												and experience.  Other important factors to be considered include the products pay model. Wether a freemium model
												with microtransactions for skins ect is adopted or an initial upfront cost model with less focus on microtransactions,
												with both having proven success within the genre. Additionally it is important to consider how sustainable
												the game's model is, perhaps allowing for Users to not only play on licensed servers and modded servers but also pay for
												their own servers. With these proposed monetisation methods the product can be financially sustainable as well as
												profitable. Due to the nature of the title it is also important that DLC is released progressively throughout the
												products lifetime that is not just premium but also free so that users are not alienated by a paywall. <p>

											<p>I believe a game of this caliber can be made utilising a well designed commercial engine such as Unity or Unreal.
												As well as graphical softwares such as Blender, Maya ect. to construct the in-game textures and models. I have
												chosen these softwares as they've proven to be reliable and allow for heavy user customisation. Other programs
												that could be potentially beneficial is Adobe Photoshop in constructing textures, as well as promotional material and
												Adobe Premiere for also creating the latter. <p>

											<p>In terms of skill required in order to undertake this project I would say that I would need to pick up
												either Unity or Unreal in order to construct the game itself and refine my skill at using Maya
												and Photoshop to create the game's environment. Both Unity and Unreal are open source engines requiring
												a licensing fee for publishing a game so acquiring them won't necessarily take much effort likewise
												with Maya and Photoshop (Blender might be a good alternative since it is far cheaper but has far less
												features compared to Maya). However this is a project that would take far too long to release if undertaken
												purely by myself, I would most likely need to hire a team of developers to tackle different aspects of
												the game to ensure it is released in a timely fashion. <p>

											<p>If my project is successful and the game is released with all the pre-described features I would
												hope for the community of Open-World Survival Game enthusiasts to appreciate the entry, and be provided
												a game that they can play on the regular aside from ARK, Minecraft, Conan Exiles and other popular games of
												the genre. As well as provide a lasting impression on the industry by demonstrating that whilst the
												genre may be inflated by clones of ARK and Minecraft, divergent games can still come to be; Ones that are
												not only fresh but innovative and fun. <p>
